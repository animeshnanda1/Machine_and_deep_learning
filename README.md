# Titanic-Kaggle_scikit_learn
* In the [first notebook](https://github.com/animeshnanda1/Machine_and_deep_learning/blob/main/kaggle_titanic.ipynb) of this repositry using the classic Titanic dataset from Kaggle, I will train some of the machine learning model (which I understand). At the end I will summarise the accuracy results for different ML models. 
* Deep learning notebook (to be updated)
